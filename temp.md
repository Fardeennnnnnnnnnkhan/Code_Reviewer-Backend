❌ Bad Code:\n```javascript\nfunction sum() { return a + b }\n```\n\n🔍 Issues:\n* ❌ The function `sum`
attempts to add variables `a` and `b` without them being defined within the function's scope or passed as arguments.\n*
❌ There are no input parameters specified for the `sum` function, meaning it cannot be used to sum arbitrary numbers
passed to it.\n\n✅ Recommended Fix:\n\n```javascript\nfunction sum(a, b) { return a + b }\n```\n\n💡 Improvements:\n\n*
✔ The function now accepts two arguments, `a` and `b`, which are used in the summation.\n* ✔ The function is now
reusable for any two numbers passed as arguments.
